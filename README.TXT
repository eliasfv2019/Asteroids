Asteroids
I added a Black Hole to the game that removes everything that touches it. I did this by making multiple methods which used an 'if' loop to see if anything was touching the black hole. If it was, then it would be removed.
I also added a wormhole that, if you touch it, spawns you in a random place, then despawns but another one is generated.
I added a missile that will follow the asteroid within a certian radius. This was done with the 'turn towards' action.
